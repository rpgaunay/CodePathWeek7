2. CVE-2015-3440: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
    - Vulnerability types: XSS Attack
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
    - GIF Walkthrough: You will see me leave a reply as an unauthenticated user with
      the attacker's JavaScript.
    - Summary:
      - I logged out of WordPress in order to unauthenticate myself. I then left a reply
        to my site that was so large, it was truncated. Because of this, the JavaScript
        went undetected and caused a JavaScript alert.
    - Steps to recreate: Paste a comment, while unauthenticated, > 64kb 
      containing a JavaScript alert.
